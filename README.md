# Localization #

  * To add your own language open the _lang_ folder https://github.com/Boehrsi/resizy/tree/master/lang and create a file named like the language you want to add. The file name will be displayed inside the program.
  * Open one of the given language files and copy the content to the new file. Translate all entries on the right side of the equal sign and just save the file.
  * The file should be formated as ISO-8859-1 because of the pretending of the Java properties object.
  * If you add a new localization feel free to submit it to the project here on GitHub to help other users. Would be much appreciated.
